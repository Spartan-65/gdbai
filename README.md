Based on the given information, it seems that there is a segmentation fault happening at line 8 in the "main" function of the "debug_demo.c" file. 

Segmentation faults are commonly caused by accessing memory that the program does not have permission to access, such as dereferencing a null pointer or accessing an array out of bounds.

To further investigate the issue, we can examine the values of the registers and the stack trace.

Registers:
- rax: 93824992235873
- rbx: 0
- rsp: 0x7fffffffdd10
- rip: 0x55555555516d (address of the current instruction)
- r8: 140737353764624
- r9: 140737353912384
- rcx: 93824992247232
- rdx: 140737488346696
- rsi: 140737488346680
- rdi: 1

--Type <RET> for more, q to quit, c to continue without paging--
Stack trace:
- #0 main () at debug_demo.c:8

To find the cause of the segmentation fault, we need to examine the code at line 8 of the "debug_demo.c" file. It is also important to analyze any other relevant parts of the code that may lead to this issue if the problem is not immediately apparent.

Please provide the code at line 8 and any other relevant code so that we can assist you further in debugging the issue.
